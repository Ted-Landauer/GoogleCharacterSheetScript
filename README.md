# GoogleCharacterSheetScript
This repo holds the code I wrote to automate the character sheets in Will's Homebrew D&amp;D game

To use this file you will need access to the character sheet created by, and that belongs to, Will.

After you have access to the character sheet then you will need to open the google script editor from the chracter sheet. This will tie 
the script to that specific document and allow it to run upon refreshing the document.

Afterwards you will need to just copy and paste this code to your new script editor
